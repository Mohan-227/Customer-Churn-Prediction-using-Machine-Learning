# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict telecom customer churn. Includes data preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression &amp; Random Forest), and evaluation.


## 🚀 Project Overview

Churn prediction is a common real-world problem faced by telecom and subscription-based companies. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project uses a publicly available dataset to classify whether a customer is likely to churn or not based on their usage patterns and demographic information.
